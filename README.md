# rice-binary-classification-pytorch
Binary rice classification using a PyTorch-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This project works on tabular rice feature data, applies normalization, and trains a fully connected neural network with ReLU and Sigmoid activations. The model is trained using Binary Cross Entropy loss and Adam optimizer, classification report, and confusion matrix.
